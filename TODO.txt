Known Bugs:
-----------
- High(Variable) fps while saving video with stream fps using video_stream.save_queue
    temp fix: stream_fps//2 line 101 -> home_security_system.py

- The same face maybe recognised twice (Coords overlap)
- Memory runs out if movement is for a very long time
- Win10Toast requires dependencies that isn' pip installed.

To implement:
-------------
- Multiple threads for motion detection on multiple camera streams,
    single thread for face detection and recognition which accesses a combined queue.
- Variable number of images for registered_faces
- Settings
    - Option to disable save if no faces detected
