Known Bugs:
1) High fps while saving video with stream fps using video_stream.save_queue
    temp fix: stream_fps//2 line 101 -> home_security_system.py
2) Doesn't work when the registered faces dict is empty.
    temp fix: register face everytime)
3) The same face maybe recognised twice
4) The bounding box might be a little off
    solution: fix face coordinates, remove_extra_faces coords doesn't align
5) Memory runs out if movement is for a very long time


To implement:
1) Notify user if movement greater than threshold
2) Multiple threads for motion detection on multiple camera streams,
    single thread for face detection and recognition which accesses a combined queue.
3) Save registered faces dictionary
